Coffee Filter
=============

Coffee Filter is a collection of coffeescript helpers I've used across projects. I didn't make all of them and some I customized, but I've credited other authors where appropriate. Included are:

- hover tags for showing notes on an element (e.g., a username when
  hovering over an avatar)
- placeholder text for browsers that don't support the html5 spec (requires
  modernizr)
- textarea autoexpand when typing large blocks of text
- fill a square with an image of arbitrary dimensions
- position an image of arbitrary dimensions in a square
- saving and default states for buttons/links when using ajax
- autolink urls in a block of text (great for comments!)
- set a custom tabindex on an array of items
- outerHTML()
- a check to see if keyboard shortcuts should be enabled (if not ie8 or
  typing in a field)

You are welcome to throw this file into your project, but you may find
it wise to pick and choose which functions you'd like to use.


Requirements
------------

jQuery, and in some cases, modernizr and underscore
