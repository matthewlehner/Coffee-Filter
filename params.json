I didn't make all\r\nof them and some I customized, but I tried to credit other authors\r\nwhere appropriate. Included are:\r\n\r\n- hover tags for showing additional notes (e.g., a username when\r\n  hovering over an avatar)\r\n- placeholder text for browsers that don't support it (requires\r\n  modernizr)\r\n- textarea autoexpand when typing large blocks of text\r\n- position an image of arbitrary dimensions in a square\r\n- saving and unsave states for buttons/links when using ajax\r\n- autolink urls in a block of text (great for comments!)\r\n- set a custom tabindex on an array of items\r\n- outerHTML()\r\n- a check to see if keyboard shortcuts should be enabled (if not ie8 or\r\n  typing in a field)\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\njQuery, and in some cases, modernizr\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Michael P.
